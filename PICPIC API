PICPIC API


http://cloud.picpicsocial.com/api/v1/events/ID.json?token=TOKEN&id=ID(same as b4)

api is just to say we're using the api
v1 is the version....dumbass
events means we're looking for events...
token is needed. reappropriated from v2.6.9.2 of Picpic Social - Device Server
token is df95ad233ad8ac1fe6b0bc6f82a08811

nope, actually turns out token is just provided by the app when you sign in

checks www.seyeco.com/Service.asmx
Therse actually some interesting stuff here
facebook secret, madrill key, instagram_secret, twitter secret, weibo_appkey, weibo_appsecret
this is some ajax stuff. could be unique, could be ubiquitous between everyoene. lets find out....l8r

then seyeco.com/Updates/UpdateVersionPPS.xml
which contains current eversion of picpic, (2.6.9.6),
upadte url, and a changelogl. in an xml file. duh

GET the sign_in page
nab the authenticity token
then log in :)
